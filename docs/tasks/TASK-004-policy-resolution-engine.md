# Task: Policy Resolution Engine & Debugging Tool

## Meta Information

- **Task ID**: `TASK-004`
- **Title**: Implement policy resolution and transparency tooling
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Priority**: P0
- **Created**: 2025-09-16
- **Updated**: 2025-09-16
- **Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks
- **Actual Effort**: TBD

## Related Documents

- **PRD**: docs/product/prd-main.md
- **ADR**: TBD
- **Dependencies**: TASK-003

## Description

Build the backend logic that determines the applicable policy for a given user, organization, and expense category, honoring precedence (user-specific over organization-wide) and enforcing limits. Provide a debugging interface that explains which policy was selected and why, helping admins troubleshoot conflicts and users understand applicable rules.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Deterministic policy resolution engine selects correct policy per request context
- [ ] Precedence rules prioritize user-specific policies over organization-wide defaults
- [ ] Engine exposes structured reasoning output for debugging tool consumption
- [ ] Debugging UI/API allows admins to run simulations for a user/category pair
- [ ] Automated tests cover overlapping policies, missing policies, and edge cases

## TODOs

- [ ] Define resolution service with clear inputs/outputs and error handling
- [ ] Implement precedence, limit enforcement, and manual vs auto-review routing logic
- [ ] Build admin-facing debugging interface using engine reasoning output
- [ ] Integrate engine with tRPC middleware for downstream expense handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests plus integration scenarios for policy selection
- [ ] Document resolution algorithm, precedence rules, and debugging workflows

## Progress Updates

### 2025-09-16 - Team
**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: Task scoped based on PRD policy requirements
**Blockers**: Requires policy definitions from TASK-003
**Next Steps**: Design engine interfaces and data contracts once policy schema finalized

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Code review completed

## Notes

Consider memoizing policy lookup results for repeated access patterns, while ensuring organization scoping remains intact.
