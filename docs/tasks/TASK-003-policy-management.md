## Description

Provide tooling for organization admins to create and manage reimbursement policies at both organization-wide and user-specific levels. Policies must support linking to categories, maximum amounts per period, review routing (auto-approval vs manual review), and precedence rules. Lay groundwork for the policy resolution engine by storing structured policy definitions that capture review rules and limits.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Policies can be created, edited, and deleted for each organization
- [ ] Policy model supports organization-wide and user-specific scopes with precedence metadata
- [ ] Policies capture limits (amount + period) and review routing flag
- [ ] UI clearly indicates policy scope, applicable categories, and review behaviour
- [ ] Tests verify CRUD operations, scope enforcement, and validation rules

## TODOs

- [ ] Design Prisma schema for policies with category references and scope fields
- [ ] Implement admin-facing forms and views for creating/updating policies
- [ ] Add validation for overlapping policies and precedence handling
- [ ] Update tRPC procedures with role checks and data isolation enforcement
- [ ] Write integration tests for policy operations and scope resolution basics
- [ ] Document policy configuration patterns and examples for admins

## Progress Updates

### 2025-09-16 - Team
**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: Task documented based on PRD requirements
**Blockers**: Must build on category and membership features
**Next Steps**: Finalize schema design once TASK-001 and TASK-002 are underway

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Code review completed

## Notes

Consider storing policy review routing as an enum to simplify downstream policy resolution logic.
